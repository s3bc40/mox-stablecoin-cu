# Stablecoin

## Introduction

1. Users can deposit $200 of ETH
2. They can then mint $50 of Stablecoin
    1. This means they will have a 4/1 ratio of collateral to stablecoin (200/50 = 4/1)
    2. We will set a required collateral ratio of 2/1
    3. If the price of ETH drops, for example to $50, others should be able to liquidate those users!
